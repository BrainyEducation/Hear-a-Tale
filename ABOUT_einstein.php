                <p>Kindergarten children in under-performing schools who regularly listened to our rhymes and stories for 9 months improved their vocabulary scores from the 27th to the 47th percentile. Three years later on statewide 3rd grade reading tests they scored in the higher range 33% more often than classmates who had not listened to our rhymes and stories, and scored at the lower range at a rate of only 7.6% compared to 16.1% of their classmates (see "<a href="http://www.rcboe.org/download.axd?file=b6dda0b8-26b4-46e3-bff3-4380a3c910b0&dnldType=Resource">Data on PPVT and Reading Scores</a>").</p>
                <p>The at-risk young children most in need of and most likely to benefit from our resources rarely have online computer access to this site, but most have home access to a DVD player, Xbox or PlayStation. We will support anyone interested in distributing free copies of our 10-hour DVD childrenâ€™s library based on 50 stories and hundreds of rhymes from our website. Teachers, administrators, donors, researchers or others with a non-commercial interest can contact us at rhymeazoo@gru.edu to receive a free master DVD. Virtually any large city has a company which can use this master to manufacture and deliver mass copies with surface artwork and envelopes at less than a dollar each. Any individual teacher, however, can purchase blank discs for less than 50 cents each and make copies one by one on any personal computer able to make copies of a DVD.<br></p>
