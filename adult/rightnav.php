<h3>Welcome</p></h3>
<p>Welcome to the old version of the audiobooks website Hear a Tale.</p>
<h4>Why the 'old version'?</h4>
<p>Hear a Tale is currently undergoing major renovations. In specific, the children's section of the website is recieving a major overhaul.
Hear a Tale's development staff is only one person, and thus such an extensive redesign can take a long time. </p>
<p>As the Children's Section is currently our primary focus, the new version of the Students and Adults section, as well as Southern Literature,
is not yet ready for use. Until then, please enjoy the website as it has been in the past.</p>
